The DH Co-Op based in the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages holds workshops, co-working sessions, talks, and social events for people at all levels interested in applying digital humanities methods to non-English materials.

The DLCL has a long history of supporting digital humanities work, including having a joint Academic Technology Specialist position with the Library for over a decade. There have been numerous DH-oriented DLCL Research Units over the years, including the current Slavic DH and AI in Literatures, Cultures, and Languages groups. The DH Co-Op adds to this landscape an ongoing, casual venue for DH scholars to get feedback on their work, troubleshoot technical issues, and share insights with colleagues.
